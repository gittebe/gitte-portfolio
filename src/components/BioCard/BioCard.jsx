          I'm a web developer and CPACC-certified accessibility specialist with a strong academic background in research and education. I bring a unique perspective to web development through my interdisciplinary experience in anthropology, disability studies, and inclusive design. After completing an intensive web development bootcamp at Technigo in Stockholm, I have been actively involved in building accessible and user-friendly web applications using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Node.js. My current pro-bono work focuses on creating inclusive websites for small organizations and community initiatives, aligning with my commitment to digital equity and universal design.

          Before transitioning into tech, I spent over a decade in academia and education, working internationally as a researcher, lecturer, and language instructor. My doctoral work explored accessibility and inclusion in post-conflict Uganda, and Iâ€™ve led international research collaborations, taught in multicultural classrooms, and curated exhibitions.

          Fluent in German and English, with professional working proficiency in Swedish, I am now seeking to join collaborative teams in Austria that value accessibility, innovation, and purposeful design.
