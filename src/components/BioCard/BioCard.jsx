        <Body>
          Before transitioning into tech, I spent over a decade in academia and education, working internationally as a researcher, lecturer, and language instructor. My doctoral work explored accessibility and inclusion in post-conflict Uganda, and Iâ€™ve led international research collaborations, taught in multicultural classrooms, and curated exhibitions.

          Fluent in German and English, with professional working proficiency in Swedish, I am now seeking to join collaborative teams in Austria that value accessibility, innovation, and purposeful design.
